JoinEqWithDTMsg
===============
**Usage**

.. code-block:: chapel

   use JoinEqWithDTMsg;


or

.. code-block:: chapel

   import JoinEqWithDTMsg;

.. data:: param TRUE_DT = 0

.. data:: param ABS_DT = 1

.. data:: param POS_DT = 2

.. function:: proc +(x: atomicint, y: atomicint)

.. function:: proc +=(X: [?D] int, Y: [D] atomicint)

.. function:: proc binarySearch(a: [?D] int, x: int): int

   
   Stole this code from Bill's Merge.chpl until we merge the PR's
   This version does not throw exceptions
   Given a *sorted*, zero-up array, use binary search to find the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to a target.
   

.. function:: proc findMatch(v: int, seg: [?segD] int, ukeys: [segD] int, perm: [?aD] int): (bool, range)

.. function:: proc joinEqWithDT(a1: [?a1D] int, seg: [?segD] int, ukeys: [segD] int, perm: [?a2D] int, t1: [a1D] int, t2: [a2D] int, dt: int, pred: int, resLimitPerLocale: int)

.. function:: proc joinEqWithDTMsg(cmd: string, payload: bytes, st: borrowed SymTab): string throws

   
   joinEqWithDT is a specialized inner-join on equality between
   two integer arrays where the time-window predicate is also true.
   a1: is the first array
   g2: is a GroupBy of the second array a2
   (seg,ukeys,perm) are derived from a2 by doing a GroupBy
   t1: time stamp array corresponding to a1
   t2: time stamp array corresponding to a2
   dt: is the delta time
   pred: is the dt-predicate ("absDT","posDT","trueDT")
   resLimit: is how many answers can you tolerate ;-)
